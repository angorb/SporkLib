/**
 * An application Environment for HTTP requests.  Mangles standard
 * PHP request variables and such into objects that can be used
 * cleanly by the Application and Controller classes.
 *
 * Once upon a time, Application and Request between them handled
 * what little this class does.  The advantage of decoupling
 * our Request object from things like PHP superglobals is that we
 * can then adopt the same application to other execution
 * models without worrying about the specifics of a PHP SAPI or
 * what-have-you.  By mapping other forms of input onto the same
 * interfaces we've used to build a web application, we can more
 * easily reuse utility functions and expose a code surface for
 * unit testing.
 *
 * Besides the command-line client that prompted this, we might
 * consider possiblities like text-to-speech, an e-mail gateway,
 * or APIs as thin translation layers to the mainline application.
